# Sound Files Required

The following sound files should be added to this directory:

1. `tap.mp3` - Sound played when successfully tapping a dot
2. `miss.mp3` - Sound played when a dot disappears without being tapped
3. `levelUp.mp3` - Sound played when advancing to the next level
4. `gameOver.mp3` - Sound played when the game ends
5. `bonus.mp3` - Sound played when getting bonus time

Note: Sound files should be in MP3 format and kept small in size for optimal performance.
