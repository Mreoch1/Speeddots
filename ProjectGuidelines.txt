# SpeedDots Project Guidelines

## Project Overview
SpeedDots is an iOS game where players tap dots that appear on the screen to score points. The game features increasing difficulty levels, time pressure, and sound effects.

## Current Project Structure
- SpeedDots/
  - SpeedDotsApp.swift (Main app entry point)
  - Models/
    - Dot.swift (Dot model with properties and animation states)
    - GameState.swift (Game state management)
  - ViewModels/
    - GameViewModel.swift (Game logic and state management)
  - Views/
    - GameView.swift (Main game view with menu, gameplay, pause, and game over screens)
  - Resources/
    - Sounds/ (Sound effect files)
  - Utils/
    - SoundManager.swift (Sound management system)

## Completed Features
1. Basic project structure setup
2. Dot model implementation
3. Game state model
4. Initial game view model with basic logic
5. Main game view implementation including:
   - Menu screen with high score display
   - Game play view with score, level, and timer
   - Pause screen with resume and main menu options
   - Game over screen with score display and replay option
6. Basic dot generation and rendering
7. Basic tap detection and scoring
8. High score tracking with UserDefaults
9. Game timer functionality:
   - 60-second countdown timer
   - Pause/resume functionality
   - Bonus time for successful taps
   - Auto game over when time runs out
   - Dots disappear if not tapped within 2 seconds
10. Animations and visual feedback:
    - Smooth dot appearance/disappearance animations
    - Tap effect animations
    - Screen transition animations
    - Dynamic dot colors
    - High score celebration animation
    - Button interaction animations
    - Scale and opacity animations for dots
11. Sound system implementation:
    - Sound manager with enable/disable functionality
    - Sound effects for:
      - Dot taps
      - Missed dots
      - Level up
      - Game over
      - Bonus time
    - Sound toggle button in menu

## TODO List
1. Create settings/difficulty levels
2. Add background music option
3. Polish UI design
4. Add particle effects for tap feedback
5. Implement combo system for quick successive taps
6. Add tutorial/instructions screen
7. Create different game modes
8. Add achievements system
9. Implement local leaderboard
10. Add haptic feedback
11. Optimize performance for different devices
12. Add difficulty progression system
13. Implement power-ups system
14. Add social sharing features
15. Add accessibility features
